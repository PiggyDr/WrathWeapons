if anyone particularly cares here's a list of all the stuff i stole
bioswrathweapons:textures/block/delightful_pan_tray_top.png is directly copied from farmersdelight:textures/block/cooking_pot_tray_top.png
net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.client.event.ClientModEventSubscriber#onModelBake is copied from vectorwing.farmersdelight.client.event.ClientSetupEvents#onModelBake with superficial changes
net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.client.event.ClientModEventSubscriber#onModelRegister is directly copied from vectorwing.farmersdelight.client.event.ClientSetupEvents#onModelRegister. idk if this should even really be put on this list since its a fairly standard ModelEvent.RegisterAdditional subscriber
net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.client.model.BallsDelightfulPanModel is almost entirely copied from vectorwing.farmersdelight.client.model.SkilletModel with changes made to the item's transformation on the model and the model id
the properties of net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.block.BallsDelightfulPanBlock are copied from the skillet's properties in wherever fd registers its blocks
obviously net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.item.BallsDelightfulPanItem#isPlayerNearHeatSource is copied from vectorwing.farmersdelight.common.item.SkilletItem#isPlayerNearHeatSource
net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.item.BallsDelightfulPanItem$BDPEvents and its method is copied from vectorwing.farmersdelight.common.item.SkilletItem#SkilletEvents
net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.block.entity.BallsDelightfulPanBlockEntity is copied from whatever block entity class the skillet uses
either the entirety of net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.block.BallsDelightfulPanBlock or a lot of its methods were copied from vectorwing.farmersdelight.common.block.SkilletBlock (probably the latter)
