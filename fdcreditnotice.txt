if anyone particularly cares here's a list of all the stuff i stole (TODO: finish the list)
bioswrathweapons:textures/block/delightful_pan_tray_top.png is directly copied from farmersdelight:textures/block/cooking_pot_tray_top.png
net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.client.event.ClientModEventSubscriber::onModelBake is copied from vectorwing.farmersdelight.client.event.ClientSetupEvents::onModelBake with superficial changes
net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.client.event.ClientModEventSubscriber::onModelRegister is directly copied from vectorwing.farmersdelight.client.event.ClientSetupEvents::onModelRegister
net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.client.model.BallsDelightfulPanModel is almost entirely copied from vectorwing.farmersdelight.client.model.SkilletModel with changes made to the item's transformation on the model and the model id
the properties of net.mcreator.bioswrathweapons.block.BallsDelightfulPanBlock are copied from the skillet's properties in wherever fd registers its blocks
i think thats it but it probably isn't
